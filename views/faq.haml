  %h3 What is Git Notifier?
  .answer
    %p Git Notifier is a service that helps you keep track of all the events happening to your GitHub user and repositories.<br />If you're watching a lot of repositories and following a lot of people your timeline will most certainly be cluttered in events and it's easy to miss something that could be nice to know, like somebody that starred or started watching one of your repositories or even following you and Git Notifier will even let you know when somebody is no longer following you.<br />You can decide how often you wish to receive notifications (as soon as possible or in a nice daily or weekly report) and for which events.

  %h3 Is it free?
  .answer
    %p Short answer: yes. In the future we may have to offer premium services (eg: better email deliverability, notifications checks happening more often) for a small fee should the server costs increase too much.<br />Anyway, since this project is completely open source you will always be able to just host you own version of Git Notifier for free.
