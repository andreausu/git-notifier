      %strong What is Git Notifier?
      %br
        Git Notifier is a service that helps you keep track of all the events happening to your GitHub user and repositories.<br />
        If you're watching a lot of repositories and following a lot of people your timeline will most certainly be cluttered in events
        and it's easy to miss something that could be nice to know, like somebody that starred or started watching
        one of your repositories or even following you and Git Notifier will even let you know when somebody is no longer following you.<br />
        You can decide how often you wish to receive notifications (as soon as possible or in a nice daily or weekly report) and for which events.
    %p.col-md-4.col-sm-6
      %strong Is it free?
      %br
        Yes! In the future we may have to offer premium services (eg: better email deliverability, ...)
        for a small fee should the server costs increase too much.<br />
        Anyway, since this project is open source you will always be able to just host your own version of Git Notifier for free.
    %p.col-md-4.col-sm-6
      %strong Is Git Notifier open source?
      %br
        Yes! We love OSS, so rest assured that this project will always be completely open source.<br />
        You can find all the code that powers this service on <a href="https://github.com/andreausu/git-notifier">GitHub</a>.<br />
        You are more than welcome to contibute if you'd like to!
    %p.col-md-4.col-sm-6
      %strong Will you send me spam?
      %br
        No, never, we all hate spammers so I will never be one.
    %p.col-md-4.col-sm-6
      %strong Can I choose to receive only some type of notifications?
      %br
        Yes, you can select which type of notifications you wish to receive right from your profile preferences,
        just login and you'll see the link in the top bar.<br />
        From there you will also be able to change the notifications frequency.
